| 1        | Login to AWS Console | Change console theme (dark/light)<br>Add bookmarks for: IAM, EC2, S3, CloudWatch<br>Explore service search, region selection<br>|*|
| 2        | **Create Two Users**:<br>Create two users within the appropriate IAM demo groups: [Developers Group] <br>[QA Group] | Examine the policies attached to each group.<br>Simulate each user's access to various resources using the IAM Policy Simulator.|Developers should have permissions to **read/write to AWS CodeCommit** and deploy code to **Elastic Beanstalk or EC2** QA Engineers should have **read-only access to CodeCommit**, and permissions to view logs in **CloudWatch** and **X-Ray** for troubleshooting.|
| 3        | Use IAM Policy Simulator:<br>- Simulate each user's access to various resources using the **IAM Policy Simulator**.|For Developers: Verify if they can **push code** to the repository.<br>For QA Engineers: Verify if they can access **CloudWatch logs** and troubleshoot issues.| **Test and Modify Permissions**: After simulating actions, if access is denied, adjust the IAM policies to provide the correct permissions.<br>For example, give the **QA Engineers** permission to access **CloudWatch** logs or allow **Developers** to push code to CodeCommit # "Answer" Developers<br> `AWSCodeCommitReadOnly`: Allows read access to the code repository in AWS CodeCommit.<br>`AWSCodeDeployFullAccess`: Allows developers to deploy the code using AWS CodeDeploy.<br>`AmazonS3FullAccess`: Enables read and write access to the S3 buckets related to the project.<br>*Custom policy for Elastic Beanstalk or EC2 instances deployment, which allows developers to create, update, and delete resources related to the application.* QA Engineers:<br> `AWSCodeCommitReadOnly`: Allows read access to the code repository in AWS CodeCommit.<br> `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess`: Enables read access to the S3 buckets related to the project.<br> `CloudWatchReadOnlyAccess`: Allows QA engineers to access logs from Amazon CloudWatch.<br> `AWSXRayReadOnlyAccess`: Provides read access to AWS X-Ray to help QA engineers in troubleshooting and performance analysis.|
